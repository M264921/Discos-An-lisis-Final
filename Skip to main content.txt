This is a complete zero-effort junk article. The text reads like it was written by chatgpt, and the benchmarks are, as ever, completely useless, with the cpu test being just the usual shitty freeware Cinebench test, and the battery life test being run with the displays at their individual max brightnesses, rather than to a standard actual brightness. It isn't worth reading.

why is cinebench shitty? it's a good measure of a CPU raw performance.

agree that additional productivity oriented benchmarks would add value. lazy article indeed.

When I got my wife a laptop for here work last summer besides the price the gaming performance was a big draw into getting her a Ryzen machine vs a Snapdragon. You see, our children regularly have friends over and it is nice to have a spare Fortnite machine for the kids. We can't be the only parents who think that way.

Honestly the Snapdragon machines in general seem to be in an awkward position. If all you care about is web browsing, office work, and battery life, and don't need full x86 compatibility or game, well might as well just get a Mac. Those are better for that use case. If you do even light gaming or have one or two oddball programs that don't play nice with the compatibility layer then an AMD or Intel machine makes more sense. The niche were the Snapdragon laptops make sense is just small.

There never was a point and I don't think there ever will be.

I never saw a good answer to the question: who is the target of these? Business doesn't want this because any incompatibility would bite the executive signing off on these. End users at this price point? I just don't see a target audience.

If Qualcomm actually matched or got close to Apple M series's perf/power I'd get one tbh... Love my MacBook's battery life, performance on battery, quietness/temps etc but prefer Windows

But instead this is barely more powerful or efficient than Intel/AMD (and even weaker in many ways e.g. GPU) while having a ton of incompatibilities

People that want fast laptops that aren't space heaters. price point is not really an issue unless you unironically compare business machines to cheap gaming laptops

ARM is a blessing for mobile devices and Apple has shown how much can be done with it. However, splitting the Windows "market" into two definitely wasn't a good decision. Windows on ARM is useless if you do anything other than very basic tasks. Apple doesn't have this problem as they switched everything to ARM and have a unified architecture across their Mac devices.

I've found this post while researching Windows on ARM for the first time, and discovering that most posts are negative but are 7 months old. I am interested to know if the opinion has changed after updates to Windows and to popular software since then, resulting in a decent level of compatibility and performance; however, reading this thread does not paint a positive picture overall.

I've started down this path while considering a laptop for my son to use while preparing for A levels and to take to University later this year. He currently uses a Chromebook for school and has no complaints, but almost exclusively uses Google Classroom, Google Office and online services (YT, Netflix, etc).

I'm concerned that a Chromebook won't cut it at University in terms of software capability, but I think he will benefit from a laptop that can get through a whole day of lectures on battery. Being portable is a bonus provided by something like MS Surface, but not essential (as long as it's not an overly heavy laptop). On this basis, I'm looking at Snapdragon/Windows laptops for offering great battery life and decent performance, notably the Asus ProArt PZ13 that I've found on sale. I know it won't run many games, but I feel most laptops that are ideal for taking to university classes are not going to be ideal for gaming.

TLDR, will I regret getting him a Snapdragon X laptop for uni?

Bought an ARM laptop, just for the sheer trauma of handling Connected Standby / Modern Standby on x86 laptops

As I don't play games on my laptop, everything I need on the laptop works flawlessly (fingers crossed)

Admittedly I don't have much experience with modern AMD/Intel machines, but this Snapdragon runs cold, only barely warm, and I can't hear the fan spinning at all. It's night and day compared to my toasty, loud Intel 6th gen XPS and 7th gen MacBook
